# LongT5

## Overview

The LongT5 model was proposed in [LongT5: Efficient Text-To-Text Transformer for Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07916)
by Mandy Guo, Joshua Ainslie, David Uthus, Santiago Ontanon, Jianmo Ni, Yun-Hsuan Sung and Yinfei Yang. It's an
encoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting. LongT5 model is an extension of
T5 model, and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2)
Transient-Global attention.


The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Recent work has shown that either (1) increasing the input length or (2) increasing model size can improve the
performance of Transformer-based neural models. In this paper, we present a new model, called LongT5, with which we
explore the effects of scaling both the input length and model size at the same time. Specifically, we integrated
attention ideas from long-input transformers (ETC), and adopted pre-training strategies from summarization pre-training
(PEGASUS) into the scalable T5 architecture. The result is a new attention mechanism we call {\em Transient Global}
(TGlobal), which mimics ETC's local/global attention mechanism, but without requiring additional side-inputs. We are
able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several summarization tasks and outperform the original T5 models on
question answering tasks.*
